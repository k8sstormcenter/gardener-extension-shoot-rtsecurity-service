## Common Issues and Fixes

### Extension pods can't reach virtual garden API (i/o timeout)

**Symptom**: Extension pods in `extension-extension-shoot-falco-service-*` namespace crash with connection timeout to the virtual garden API (172.18.x.x LoadBalancer IP).

**Root cause**: In local kind setup, the virtual garden API is exposed via a LoadBalancer IP in the private range (172.18.0.0/12). The extension pods need the network policy label `networking.gardener.cloud/to-private-networks: allowed`.

**Fix**: Already applied in `charts/gardener-extension-shoot-falco-service/templates/deployment.yaml` — the pod template includes:
```yaml
networking.gardener.cloud/to-private-networks: allowed
networking.resources.gardener.cloud/to-virtual-garden-istio-ingress-istio-ingressgateway-inte-02e09: allowed
networking.resources.gardener.cloud/to-all-shoots-kube-apiserver-tcp-443: allowed
```

### Disk pressure on kind node

**Symptom**: Worker machines get `DiskPressure` condition, machines stuck in `Terminating`, shoot reconcile fails with "machine deployments not ready".

**Fix**:
```bash
docker system prune -f
docker image prune -a -f
docker exec gardener-local-control-plane crictl rmi --prune
```

Check with: `docker exec gardener-local-control-plane df -h /`
Target: below 80% usage.

### Machine stuck in Terminating

**Symptom**: `kubectl -n shoot--local--falco-test get machines` shows machine in `Terminating` state indefinitely.

**Fix** (if drain is stuck and won't resolve):
```bash
KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_RUNTIME kubectl -n shoot--local--falco-test patch machine <name> --type=merge -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}'
```

If the shoot is completely broken, it's often faster to delete and recreate:
```bash
KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL kubectl -n garden-local annotate shoot falco-test "confirmation.gardener.cloud/deletion=true" --overwrite
KUBECONFIG=$KUBECONFIG_VIRTUAL kubectl -n garden-local delete shoot falco-test
```

### Reconcile fails: "secretRef not found in resources"

APPLIES TO US DIRECTLY: this fork passes the pixie deploy key and both registry PATs
(docker.io/entlein for duckling/node-agent, docker.io/tanzeee for AE and dx-daemon) by
reference rather than inline, because providerConfig is part of the Shoot spec and
readable by anyone who can read the Shoot. Every one of those refs needs the
spec.resources stanza below or reconcile dies at ~51%.

**Symptom**: Shoot creation fails at ~51% with error "could not generate falco configuration: custom webhook secretRef opensearch-config not found in resources".

**Root cause**: The Shoot manifest references `resourceSecretName: opensearch-config` in the destination but doesn't declare it in `spec.resources`.

**Fix**: Add to the Shoot spec:
```yaml
spec:
  resources:
  - name: opensearch-config
    resourceRef:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      name: opensearch-config
```

### Falcosidekick can't reach OpenSearch on the seed

**Symptom**: Falcosidekick logs show DNS resolution failure for `opensearch.<ns>.svc` or connection refused.

**Root cause**: Falcosidekick runs inside the shoot cluster. In local Gardener, shoot pods have their own network namespace and CoreDNS — they can't resolve seed-internal service names.

**Fix**: Deploy OpenSearch inside the shoot cluster (in `default` namespace) and set the opensearch-config Secret's `hostport` to `http://opensearch.default.svc:9200`.

### Falcosidekick startup error: OTLP.Logs.Headers unmarshalling

**Symptom**: `[ERROR] Error unmarshalling config: 'OTLP.Logs.Headers' expected type 'string', got unconvertible type 'map[string]interface{}'`

**Root cause**: Chart values template for falcosidekick passes an empty map `{}` for OTLP headers instead of an empty string or omitting the field entirely.

**Fix**: Fix in the falcosidekick chart values template (charts within the extension).
